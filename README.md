# Career Path Predictor using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

The Career Path Predictor is a machine learning program built with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to assist individuals in predicting potential career paths based on their skills, interests, and personality traits. Choosing the right career path can be a daunting task, and this tool aims to provide insights and guidance to help users make informed decisions about their professional futures.

## Introduction

The program utilizes SVM, a powerful supervised learning algorithm, to analyze input data such as skills, educational background, work experience, and personality assessments. By training on labeled data sets of various career paths, the SVM model can predict the most suitable career options for the user.

## Features

- **Input Data Analysis**: Analyze user-provided data to identify relevant features and attributes.
- **Model Training**: Train the SVM model using labeled datasets of career paths and corresponding attributes.
- **Career Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict potential career paths based on user input.
- **User Interface**: Optionally, develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the program.

## Dataset

The program requires labeled datasets containing information about different career paths and the corresponding attributes or prerequisites. These datasets should include features such as required skills, educational qualifications, job responsibilities, and advancement opportunities for each career path.

## Usage

1. **Input Data Collection**: Collect user-provided data including skills, education, work experience, and personality assessments.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the input data to extract relevant features and transform it into a format suitable for SVM training.
3. **Model Training**: Train the SVM model using the preprocessed datasets of labeled career paths.
4. **Career Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict potential career paths based on the user's input data.
5. **Feedback and Evaluation**: Collect user feedback and evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions.
6. **Improvement and Iteration**: Continuously improve the model based on user feedback and new data.

## Dependencies

The program may require the following dependencies:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
